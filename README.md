# Tetris DOM

Idea: create a game using the DOM with react hooks and try how far I can get with it... mobile native, pwa?
Condiment: a good, hard but simple/"clean" code problem solving excercise
I feel like is the analogue of writing a book for a developer. Programming gives you more context and therefore more insights about complex problems and meta problems which are usually related with profitable businesses.

##Â TODO

~- adjust shape initial original positions~

- add blast command
