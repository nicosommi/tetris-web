# Tetris with react

Idea: create a game using the DOM with react hooks and try how far I can get with it...

## WHY

Fun, practice, experiment, learn.

### Why not use canvas or a game engine?

I'm not using a game engine because this is an experiment using react hooks.
On the other hand, I'm rendering divs as a first iteration implementation, but it should be relatively easy to adapt the game state to a canvas or even an svg renderer.

## TODO

- polish settings panel
- add auto fit algorithm to rotation command
- polish shapes
- complete themes
- hide first 3 lines?

## DONE

- sound for line eat
- settings panel mechanics
- add music
- theme selector
- put keybindings as part of the joystick
- onscreen basic joystick
- add blast command
- basic game mechanism
- react native compatibility
- separate state from UI
- support theme
- test shape positions
- support levels of complexity
- expose generic handlers for alternative inputs like press
- keyboard support

## KNOWN ISSUES

- clunky rotation
