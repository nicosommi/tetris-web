# Tetris with react

Idea: create a game using the DOM with react hooks and try how far I can get with it...

## WHY

Fun, practice, experiment, learn.

### Why not use canvas or a game engine?

Because this is a experiment using react hooks.

## TODO

- add blast command
- add auto fit to rotation command
- add onscreen keyboard when native and optional on web
- add settings panel
- add theme selector
- polish shapes with gradients and transitions
- add music turned off by default
- add sounds settings on or mute (by default mute)
- add sound setting for line eating x1, x2, (x3 or more)
- add sound setting for level transition
- add sound setting for game over
- add sound setting for regular thick
- make it similar to theme c palace and adjusting a theme
- add one more level of complexity: scarsity for I, etc
- complete other themes

## DONE

- basic game mechanism
- react native compatibility
- separate state from UI
- support theme
- test shape positions
- support levels of complexity
- expose generic handlers for alternative inputs like press
- keyboard support
