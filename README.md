# Tetris with react

Idea: create a game using the DOM with react hooks and try how far I can get with it...

## WHY

Fun, practice, experiment, learn.

### Why not use canvas or a game engine?

I'm not using a game engine because this is an experiment using react hooks.
On the other hand, I'm rendering divs as a first iteration implementation, but it should be relatively easy to adapt the game state to a canvas or even an svg renderer.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- clunky rotation
- no scoreboard
