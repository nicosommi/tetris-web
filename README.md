# Tetris DOM

Idea: create a game using the DOM with react hooks and try how far I can get with it... mobile native, pwa?
Condiment: a good, hard but simple/"clean" code problem solving excercise
I feel like is the analogue of writing a book for a developer. Programming gives you more context and therefore more insights about complex problems and meta problems which are usually related with profitable businesses.

##Â TODO

- add blast command
- add auto fit to rotation command
- try it in rn 0.59+ (hooks)
- add settings panel
- add theme selector
- polish shapes with gradients and transitions
- add music turned off by default
- add sounds settings on or mute (by default mute)
- add sound setting for line eating
- add sound setting for level transition
- add sound setting for game over
- add sound setting for regular thick
- make it similar to theme c palace and adjusting a theme
- add one more level of complexity: scarsity for I, etc
- complete other themes
